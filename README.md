Software Renderer
=================

The goal of this project is for me to apply the concepts I've been learing in Math 317 (Theory of Linear Algebra) at Iowa State. 
This is an attempt to make a software 3D rendering library that has few external dependencies. As of writing, I plan on using 
Guava for its niceties, and most like Processing to make drawing the pixels easier (maybe opting for javafx or awt in the future).
